    "## 1. Historical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prisoner's Dilemma was originally formulated by **Merrill Flood** and **Melvin Dresher** at the RAND Corporation in 1950 during research into nuclear strategy. The scenario was later formalized and named by **Albert Tucker**, who created the famous \"prisoner\" narrative that gives the game its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Original Scenario\n",
    "Two prisoners are arrested and held in separate cells. They cannot communicate and must decide whether to:\n",
    "- **Cooperate** (remain silent)\n",
    "- **Defect** (betray their partner)\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes depend on both players' choices, creating a complex decision matrix that reveals fundamental tensions in human cooperation."

    "| **Defect**          | 5, 0      | 1, 1   |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring Breakdown:\n",
    "- **Mutual Cooperation (3,3)**: Both players benefit moderately\n",
    "- **Mutual Defection (1,1)**: Both players receive minimal reward\n",
    "- **Asymmetric Outcomes (0,5) or (5,0)**: One player exploits the other\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Nash Equilibrium\n",
    "The game's Nash equilibrium is mutual defection (1,1), even though mutual cooperation (3,3) would benefit both players more. This paradox illustrates why rational individual decisions can lead to irrational collective outcomes."

    "### Risk Aversion\n",
    "Players often choose to defect because it eliminates the worst-case scenario (receiving 0 points). This demonstrates how **loss aversion** influences decision-making even when cooperation offers better average outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trust and Reciprocity\n",

    "- **Initial trust**: Willingness to cooperate without guarantees\n",

    "- **Forgiveness**: Ability to return to cooperation after betrayal\n",

    "- **Projection bias**: Assuming others will make the same choice as you\n",
    "- **Confirmation bias**: Interpreting opponent moves to confirm existing beliefs\n",

    "\n",
    "**Individual Rationality**: \n",
    "- Defecting is always the \"safer\" choice regardless of what the opponent does\n",
    "- Guarantees you won't be exploited (worst case: 1 point instead of 0)\n",
    "- Offers potential for maximum individual gain (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collective Rationality**:\n",
    "- Mutual cooperation produces the best joint outcome (6 total points vs. 2 for mutual defection)\n",
    "- Creates sustainable long-term relationships\n",
    "- Builds trust and social capital\n",

    "\n",
    "The Prisoner's Dilemma remains one of the most powerful tools for understanding human cooperation, competition, and the complex relationship between individual and collective interests. This GTK+ implementation makes these abstract concepts tangible and interactive, providing an excellent platform for education, research, and personal exploration of game theory principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hands-on experimentation with different strategies and scenarios, users gain intuitive understanding of why cooperation is both essential and challenging in human societies. The game reveals fundamental insights about trust, reciprocity, and the delicate balance required for successful collaboration in an inherently competitive world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether used in academic settings or for personal learning, this application demonstrates how simple rules can generate complex behaviors - a hallmark of both game theory and human psychology."
